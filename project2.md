## Project description

This is an HTML parser to determine if the HTML tags are properly balanced and then acts as a web crawler to go and find all unique possible links that are visitable.

## How to compile and run the program

In the project2 directory, run make, then make run

## UI Design
The program starts at csu.html, crawling and parsing its way through the rest of the files before giving the results back of its findings.
