## Project description

The following test project is a combination of cryptographic knowledge we had learn up to this point, with the following project focused on decrypting and encrypting messages using the approriate methods. For more information please see (/pdf/CSCI 452_552 Project 2 Encryption Decryption.pdf)

## How to compile and run the program

Python3 <whatever file you want goes here>

## UI Design

The program is rather primative, as it only runs in command line and encrypts or decrypts the message. There is not much to it outside of the intended function to encrypt or decrypt the message in the instructed format. 

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
